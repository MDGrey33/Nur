# Recent Changes to :bookmark: Flow (Last 10 Days)

This document summarizes all relevant changes to the :bookmark: (bookmark) flow, including embedding, async processing, and vector DB integration, based on the diff in `bookmark_flow_recent_changes.diff`.

---

## 1. Async Processing and API Endpoint
- The `/api/v1/bookmark_to_confluence` endpoint was refactored to use FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` for non-blocking processing.
- The endpoint now:
  - Generates a document from the conversation using Najm assistant.
  - Stores the conversation in the DB.
  - Creates a Confluence page.
  - Retrieves the page ID and stores the page locally.
  - Schedules vectorization and upsert to ChromaDB as a background task.

## 2. Embedding and Vectorization
- The embedding logic was updated to include author and space key in the embedded text (with fallback to 'Unknown').
- The vectorization process now:
  - Embeds the page content (title, body, author, space key).
  - Stores the embedding in the DB and upserts to ChromaDB.
- The `vectorize_and_store_page` function was updated to call `upsert_page_to_chromadb` after embedding.

## 3. Data Flow and Storage
- The flow now ensures that after a bookmark event:
  - The conversation is stored in the `bookmarked_conversations` table.
  - The Confluence page is created and stored locally as a `.txt` file.
  - The page data is added to the `page_data` table in the DB.
  - The embedding is stored in the DB and ChromaDB.

## 4. Error Handling and Logging
- Improved error handling and logging throughout the flow, especially for DB and vectorization steps.
- If a page or embedding is missing, errors are logged and raised.

## 5. New and Modified Files
- `use_cases/vectorize_page.py`: Handles async vectorization and storage.
- `confluence_integration/store_page_local.py`: Pulls and stores Confluence pages locally and in the DB.
- `vector/chroma.py`: Updated to include upsert logic and robust embedding construction.
- `database/page_manager.py`: Improved error handling for embedding updates.
- `slack/reaction_manager.py`: Now POSTs to the async API endpoint instead of handling everything synchronously.
- `api/endpoint.py`: Major refactor for async and background task handling.

## 6. Potential Breaking Changes
- The embedding and storage logic now expects certain fields (e.g., `date_pulled_from_confluence`) to be present in the data. If missing, this can cause `KeyError` exceptions.
- The flow is more tightly coupled to the presence of up-to-date data in the DB and local file system.

## 7. References
- See `bookmark_flow_recent_changes.diff` for the full code diff.
- See `docs/bookmark_to_vector_flow.md` for the end-to-end flow diagram and explanation.

**If issues arise, check for missing fields in the data, ensure all background tasks complete, and verify the presence of required files and DB entries.**
